# 🏬 InvenTREE – Inventory Stockout & Overstock Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

An intelligent system that predicts **stockout** and **overstock risks** in inventory using **Machine Learning**.  
Developed and executed in **Google Colab** to support smarter supply chain management.

---

## 💡 Overview

**InvenTREE** helps businesses optimize their inventory by analyzing sales data and forecasting product demand.  
It identifies when a product is at risk of being **out of stock (stockout)** or **overstocked**, helping minimize financial losses and improve decision-making.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Predict inventory stockouts and overstocks  
- Minimize excess storage costs and lost revenue  
- Use ML models to forecast inventory demand patterns  
- Build a scalable foundation for data-driven warehouse management
